# Course Project

The course consists of a term-long, open-ended project, where three students (maximum four) team up working as a group. The topic of the project is mainly determined by you, but must be approved by the instructor. The project can be tech, business, or research related. Example topics include but not limited to

  - Reimplement an AWS serverless application. The applications include but are not limited to web application, image recognition, mobile backend, file processing, stream processing, IoT backend, and Chatbot. The students are expected to implement a partial or a complete set of functionalities of a particular application with the AWS components replaced with open-source alternatives, e.g., Apache Kafka substituted for Kinesis Stream, PostgreSQL for DynamoDB, OpenFaaS for AWS Lambda, Redis for S3, TensorFlow for Amazon Rekognition, Nginx for API Gateway, etc. The deliverable should be directly deployable to a Kubernetes cluster, such as a set of Docker images.
  - Analyzing a dataset, public or self-collected, and drawing some insights from it. A few public datasets you can use: AWS Public Datasets, SF OpenData, Google cluster workload traces;
  - Tackling a public challenge: there are many data analytics competitions held on platforms such as Kaggle, TianChi, KDDCup, and CrowdAnalytics. Students could choose their interested one and give an attempt. Neither full participation nor complete solution is required.
  - Implementing some non-trivial distributed algorithms on Spark (or other big data analytics framework).
  - Performance measurement of EC2, Spark, or Hadoop;
  - A literature survey on a specific topic covered in the course (the surveyed papers are not limited to the reading list);
  - ...

Note: Course project related to FYP (if any) is highly encouraged.

## Delivery
The delivery of the project is a project report **<= 5 pages**. All the documents must be PDF files. You should upload your report to this GitHub repository.
